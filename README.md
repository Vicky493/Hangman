## What I Learned
- Structured Python code with functions for modularity.
- Handled edge cases like invalid inputs and duplicate guesses.
- Added visual flair with ASCII art for a better console experience.

## Future Ideas
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., easy: more attempts, hard: longer words).
- Build a graphical interface with Tkinter or Pygame.
- Add a hint system or multiplayer mode.
